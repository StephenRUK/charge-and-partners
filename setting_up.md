# Setting up the partner connection

To set up a communication between your system and Charge& you must register yourself as a partner.
Registration is a two step process:
## Step 1 - Call our API to register yourself.
You can do this by submitting your details at our [__registration endpoint__](partner_registration.md).

## Step 2 - Review and partner activation
In this step we will review the registration details. Probably we'll get in touch with you and clarify a thing or two. Once this is done, we'll activate you on our platform and you are set up to work with our platform.

After your registration is complete, you can make use of our API.
